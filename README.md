# Angular-library
A library project done for school as a final project. You can borrow create an account and login, and once you're logged in you can browse, borrow and return books. If you login as an admin, you can delete books and add new ones, but you can't borrow books.

To start backend, simply position yourself in the backend directory and run the command npm start
There might be some packages that require installing because of the .gitignore file

To start frontend, simply position yourself in the library directory and run the command ng serve -o
There might be some packages that require installing because of the .gitignore file

If the connection to the database is not successful the database needs to be reset manually from this side, since it's an online database
In this case a live demonstration of the project might be the best option
